# Multivariable-Math-Calculators
A series of calculators for topics in Multivariable Mathematics. The series was a conference project for Multivariable Math:Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, Differential Eq. 

The Reduced Echelon Form Calculator was the most complex and challenging of the four in total. To use the calculator run the main program called reducedEchelonFormCalculator and give it an input of a 2D list.

The Determinant Calculator was the most enjoyable to make. I practiced recursion, hardcoding calculators for 3x3 and 4x4 matrices, and then using those functions to recursively calculate any size square matrix.
To use the function you call determinantMxN(A), where A is a 2D square list representing a matrix.

The Gram-Schmidt Calculator is fairly straightforward, it follows the Gram-Schmidt process by taking in a span of vectors and outputting a new orthogonal set.

Lastly, the Line-Of-Best-Fit Calculator builds upon the Reduced Echelon Form Calculator. It takes in a set of points in 2D and returns the line of best fit, also providing a nice graph of the points with the line.
